# Given an n*m matrix, output its absolute matrix. An absolute matrix is defined as
# a matrix in which each element is the absolute value of the original element
# in the input matrix.

# Input:
# The first row contains two integers n, m representing the dimensions of the input matrix.

# Lists : â€“ Accessing element in a list takes linear time because all the element in the lists
# are linked with each other for accessing ith element we have to traverse all the previous

# However, insertion and deletion in a list takes constant(which is not expensive at all) time
# as all the element are linked with each other for adding or removing new element
