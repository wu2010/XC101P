# Passing an integer after the ':' will cause that field to be a minimum
# number of characters wide. This is useful for making columns line up.

#  str.format() method of strings requires more manual effort.
#  Youâ€™ll still use { and } to mark where a variable will be substituted
#  and can provide detailed formatting directives
print('{:-9} YES votes  {:2.2%}'.format(42572654, 49.67))

print('We are the {} who say "{}!"'.format('knights', 'Ni'))
# A number in the brackets can be used to refer to the position
# of the object passed into the str.format() method.
print('{0} and {1}'.format('spam', 'eggs'))
print('{1} and {0}'.format('spam', 'eggs'))
